btcat is a command line tool that downloads a file using the bittorrent protocol
and outputs its contents to the standard output. btcat streams the data
sequentially, which allows processing the file in a pipeline before the whole
transfer has been completed. It is possible, for instance, to reproduce a media
file while it's still downloading.
